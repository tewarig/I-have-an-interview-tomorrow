# Function Statement + declaration

```js
function a() {
  console.log("woofff");
}
//here a is a normal function so it would give no errors to me
```

# Function Expression

```js
var b = function () {
  console.log("meow");
};
//here b is undefined and when it's called it would give an error
```

the major diffence between these two is hoisting :)
