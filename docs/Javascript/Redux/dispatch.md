# Dispatch

Dispatch is a function given to us by Redux, and lets us trigger actions.

The action contains a type, and a payload. The type is typically just a string with the name of the action. The payload contains data we need to know about. For example, we canâ€™t deposit any money without knowing the amount

how to make dispatch work ?
it is used to make changes in the state

it also take a type arugument which tells the reducer what to do?

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  if (action.type === "INCREMENT") {
    return state + 1;
  } else if (action.type === "DECREMENT") {
    return state - 1;
  }

  return state;
};

const store = createStore(reducer);

store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log("current state", store.getState());
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "INCREMENT",
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "INCREMENT",
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "DECREMENT",
});
```

instead of using if else inside the dispatch we can use switch it will work fine and make code much assable

```js
const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state + 1;
    case "DECREMENT":
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
```

now instead of increasing the counter by one we can pass payload it will help to imporve the counter and will make our code easy to read.

```js
import { createStore } from "redux";

const reducer = (state = 0, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "INCREMENT":
      return state + action.payload;
    case "DECREMENT":
      return state - action.payload;
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

const store = createStore(reducer);

store.subscribe(() => {
  console.log("current state", store.getState());
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "INCREMENT",
  payload: 1,
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "INCREMENT",
  payload: 5,
});

store.dispatch({
  type: "DECREMENT",
  payload: 2,
});
```
