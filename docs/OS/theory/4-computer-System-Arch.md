Types of computer system based on General purpose processor - 
- Single Processor System
- MultiProcessor System
- Clustered System

# Single Processor System 
- one main CPU capable of executing a general purpose instrution set including the instruction from the user.
- other special purpose processor are also present which performs device specific task. 
here we have only a general processor to perform a  specific task that's why we call it 

# Multi Processor System
Also know as pallel System or tightly coupled system.
- they have two or more processor in close commucation sharing the computer bus and sometimes the clock and memory and peripheral devices.
- In mutli processor system we will have increased throughput (performance)
- Economy of scale. (more economic then single processor system)
- It has increased Reliability (if a processor fails we still have other processor to do work)

 types of mutli processing systems
 - Symmetic Multiprocessing System
  here we have different processor , but they are actually the same (same brand model ) and they all participate in performing the task.
- Asymmetic Multiprocessing System
 here we have a main master cpu which controls the other slave cpu.

# Clustered System 
here many individual system come together to perform a task
- it provide high avaiblity. 
- they can be structured symmectrically or Asymmectrically.
